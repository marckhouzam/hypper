const sharedDependencyDesc = `
Manage the shared dependencies of a chart.

Helm charts store their shared dependencies in
'annotations.hypper.cattle.io/shared-dependencies' in Chart.yaml.

For example, this Chart.yaml declares two shared dependencies:

    # Chart.yaml
    annotations:
      hypper.cattle.io/shared-dependencies: |
        - name: prometheus
          version: "13.3.1"
          repository: "https://example.com/charts"
      hypper.cattle.io/optional-dependencies: |
        - name: postgresql
          version: "10.3.11"
          repository: "https://another.example.com/charts"


The 'name' should be the name of a chart, where that name must match the name
in that chart's 'Chart.yaml' file.

The 'version' field should contain a semantic version or version range.

The 'repository' URL should point to a Chart Repository. Hypper expects that by
appending '/index.yaml' to the URL, it should be able to retrieve the chart
repository's index. Note: 'repository' can be an alias. The alias must start
with 'alias:' or '@'.

The repository can also be defined as the path to the directory of the
dependency charts stored locally. The path should start with a prefix of
"file://". For example,

    # Chart.yaml
    dependencies:
    - name: nginx
      version: "1.2.3"
      repository: "file://../dependent_chart/nginx"

If the dependency chart is retrieved locally, it is not required to have the
repository added to hypper by "hypper add repo". Version matching is also
supported for this case.
`

const sharedDependencyListDesc = `
List all of the shared dependencies declared in a chart, showing their statuses,
and type (shared, shared-optional)

This can take chart archives and chart directories as input. It will not alter
the contents of a chart.

This will produce an error if the chart cannot be loaded, or the YAML annotations
of the shared dependencies is malformed.
